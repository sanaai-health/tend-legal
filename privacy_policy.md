Privacy Policy for Tend
Last updated: December 18, 2024
Our Commitment to Your Privacy
At Tend, we believe your health data and personal reflections belong to you. We've built our app with privacy at its core, ensuring your personal health information remains private and secure.
What We DON'T Do

We DO NOT collect, store, or access your personal health data on any servers by default
We DO NOT upload your condition logs to the cloud without your explicit consent
We DO NOT share or sell your data with third parties
We DO NOT track your symptoms or health information remotely
We DO NOT use your data for advertising or marketing purposes

How Your Data is Stored
Local Storage by Default
All your condition logs, symptom tracking, medication records, and personal notes are stored exclusively on your device using local encrypted storage (Hive database). This means:

Your data never leaves your phone unless you enable optional cloud backup
Only you can access your health information through the app
If you delete the app, all locally stored data is permanently removed
Data is encrypted at rest on your device for additional security

Optional Cloud Backup
You may choose to enable encrypted cloud backup through Firebase:

Backup is entirely optional and disabled by default
You control the encryption key
Backups can be disabled at any time
You can delete cloud backups independently of local data

Authentication Data
We only collect minimal information required for app functionality:

Email address (for authentication only)
Subscription status (to enable premium features)
Basic usage analytics (app crashes, performance metrics - non-health data only)

This data is securely managed through Firebase Authentication and is never linked to your health condition or symptom content.
Apple Health Integration
When you connect to Apple Health:

Data is fetched directly from Apple Health to your device
We do not store Apple Health data on our servers
You control which metrics to sync
You can disconnect Apple Health access at any time
Apple Health data follows Apple's privacy policies

AI Features
When you use our AI features for monthly progress cards and doctor reports:

Pattern analysis is performed using aggregated data only
GPT-4 is used only for generating personalized text for progress cards
No detailed health logs are stored on external servers
Generated reports contain only the summary information you choose to include
Your full condition logs remain private and local

Your Control and Responsibility

You have complete control over your data
You may choose to share generated reports or cards at your discretion
We are not responsible for data you choose to share outside the app
You can request account deletion by filling out our data deletion form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexjThyRZHPMT6fnZrflPsFjMVajGao6PlJrNQUSHcTV1z8rg/viewform
You can immediately delete all your data by uninstalling the app

Data Deletion
You can delete your data in two ways:

Immediate deletion: Uninstall the app from your device
Account deletion: Submit a request through our data deletion form at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexjThyRZHPMT6fnZrflPsFjMVajGao6PlJrNQUSHcTV1z8rg/viewform

Upon receiving your deletion request, we will:

Remove your authentication data from Firebase
Delete any optional cloud backups (if enabled)
Cancel any active subscriptions
Delete any associated account information

Note: Since health data is stored primarily on your device, uninstalling the app immediately removes all personal health content.
Third-Party Services
We use the following services with minimal data sharing:

Firebase Authentication (for login and account management)
Firebase Firestore (optional encrypted backup only)
Payment processors (RevenueCat, Apple App Store and Google Play Store for subscriptions)
Firebase Analytics (for app performance monitoring - non-health data only)
OpenAI GPT-4 (for progress card text generation only - aggregated patterns, not detailed logs)
Weather API (for weather correlation insights - location data not stored)

These services have their own privacy policies and handle only the minimum data required for their functions.
HIPAA Compliance Notice
Tend is designed as a personal health tracking tool and is not HIPAA compliant. We recommend:

Not using Tend as your sole medical record
Sharing generated reports with your healthcare provider at your discretion
Keeping sensitive medical information private to your device
